## Perceptron Convergence Visualizer 

The _perceptron_ is one of the first and simplest algorithms in artificial intelligence and came into being in 1969. It processes information from one (or more) feature inputs to determine a linear decision boundary for binary classification. This small project is made to aid students, like me, in learning more about the foundations of such algorithms and to help develop a geometric intuition for the underlying mathematics implemented in code. It may also be used by professors/academics teaching introductory machine learning courses to show how the perceptron algorithm learns visually. 

Running this project is simple. You can clone this repository and run the _perceptron.py_ file from the terminal, which will prompt a GUI interface to open. You can then follow the buttons and text on the screen to generate as much (and as disparate) data as you want for two classes and then prompt the algorithm to find the optimal linear predictor function. A good use of this program would be demonstrating how the perceptron fails to converge for complex decision boundaries (non-linear, radial, XOR functions) and hence motivate multi-layered networks.
